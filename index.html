                My name is Joshau Cameron. I spent almost a
                <em>decade</em> in the
                <strong>medical field</strong>. I was honorably discharged after two combat tours and four years in the Army as a
                combat medic, where I was deployed to, or visited during deployment: Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Kuwait,
                Iraq, Qatar, UAE, Germany and Ireland.

                I haven vast experience in various different scopes, from the fields in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, where I have even worked
                in well below freezing temperatures. I have learned throughout my life that life doesn't wait for you. Life
                doesn't wait for good weather or calm times. Life doesn't wait for your convenience. Hard careers sometimes
                makes for hard lives, but hard choices make for far more experienced people and workers.

                I also have a long history of volunteerism, from 5k runs for charity, security for civilian events while I was a soldier,
                and now I am a precinct chair for one of the major political parties here in Utah. I have volunteered to
                speak at many events and rallies, where I try to add energy to the crowd and use my time and skills to add
                a net positive value to the lives of Utahns, and indirectly, Americans at large.

                It may sound silly, but for about 4 years I spent time playing World of Warcraft, which immensley helped me hone my coordination
                stills with satelite personnel, as well as how to herd cats when trying to succeed at a mutual objective.
                I will admit I could have use the time more effectively, and yet I still use many of the skills learned to
                this day.
